## My process

As always, I began by setting up the HTML structure and worked on each section step by step. First, I focused on positioning all the elements to match the required design. Next, I added hover effects to the text elements. Finally, I tackled the task of displaying the icon over the image and implementing its hover effect. To achieve the desired result, I made adjustments to the HTML to align with my approach for adding the effects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to add an overlay to an image that appears when a user hovers over it. On hover, both the overlay background and the icon are displayed simultaneously, creating an interactive effect.

### Continued development

Initially, figuring out the best approach to add a hover effect that triggers two components of the code felt a bit tricky. Iâ€™m looking forward to refining my skills through continuous projects, aiming to master such techniques until they become second nature.
